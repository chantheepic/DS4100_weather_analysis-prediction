"0","# It is possible to see that there is a lot of ouliers between the pressure and windspeed. This is not very surprising since wind is an irregular characteristic of weatehr and wind is generated by changes in pressure (which also has a lot of outliers). What is more surprising is that humidity shows less outliers than the precipitation data from the NOAA dataset. Perhaps there is not much correlation between rain, pressure, and humidity."
